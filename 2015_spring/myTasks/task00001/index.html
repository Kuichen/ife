		<h2>How to become one with or without formal education</h2>
		<p>You may <span>may</span> be surprised to find out that the first question an interviewer will ask you won't be about your credentials or where you went to school. Instead, you'll be asked to show off what you have built.</p> <br />
		<p>The way to distinguish yourself and become a full-time Front-End Web Developer is to prove that you can build fantastic experiences that people love. Build websites that delight your users! Try new technologies! Show off your work to the world!</p> <br />
		<ol>
			<li>Keep up to date with current best practices</li>
			<li>Get experience by building websites using the latest technologies</li>
			<li>Get involved with the open source community, which drives the massively collaborative Front-End world</li>
		</ol>
		<br />
		<p>An awesome portfolio of work will help you stand out from the crowd and get the job you wantâ€”regardless of where you went to school.</p>
